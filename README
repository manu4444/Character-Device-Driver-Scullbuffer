------------------------How to compile--------------------------

1. Unzip the tar file to a directory and run 'make' command. This make will run the makefile present in folder consumer, producer and scullbuffer and create all the binaries necessary. The make in scullbuffer will do the necessary loading and unloading of the scull device.



-----------------------How to run the test-----------------------------------------

1. Run 'sudo ./alltestcases.sh' at the project directory. This will one by one call all the 5 test cases.
